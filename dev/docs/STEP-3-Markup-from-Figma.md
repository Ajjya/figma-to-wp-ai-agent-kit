## STEP 3: Copy Markup from Figma (via MCP)

### Objective
Extract complete HTML/CSS markup from Figma designs using Figma MCP, ensuring all pages, components, and design tokens are properly captured.

### Prerequisites
- Figma MCP is installed and authenticated
- Current task file exists with `figmaUrl` and `figmaPages[]` defined
- Task status is "WP initiated"

### Context to Gather Before Starting

Read from `tasks/current-task.json`:
- `figmaUrl` - Main Figma file URL
- `figmaPages[]` - Array of pages with nodeId and page names
- `siteStructure.pages[]` - Expected WordPress page structure

### ⚠️ STRICT RULE: ASSET DOWNLOAD IS MANDATORY

**ALL ASSETS MUST BE DOWNLOADED - NO EXCEPTIONS**
**ALL SVG code - must be converted to files and save as assets/*.svg**

During task you MUST:
1. **Parse ALL asset URLs** from Figma MCP response (format: `http://localhost:3845/assets/[hash].[ext]`)
2. **Download EVERY asset** to local folders:
   - PNG/JPG images → `dev/html/[site-name]/assets/images/`
   - SVG icons → `dev/html/[site-name]/assets/icons/`
   - Logos → `dev/html/[site-name]/assets/logos/`
3. **Verify downloads** - check file size > 0, file is valid
4. **Update HTML** - replace localhost URLs with local relative paths
5. Never create any documentation files
6. ALL SVG code - must be converted to files and save as assets/*.svg

**If an asset fails to download:**
- If impossible to download, use font-awesome or other free icons in correct style
- Do NOT skip - inform user of failed assets

### Prompt for Figma MCP

When calling Figma MCP, use this consolidated prompt:

```
Implement this design from Figma.
@[page.url from figmaPages]

Extract the complete design context for this WordPress site conversion project.

Design System Requirements:
1. Color Palette - Extract all color variables, primary/secondary/accent colors, backgrounds
2. Typography - Font families, weights, sizes (H1-H6), line height, letter spacing
3. Spacing System - Margins, padding, gaps, spacing scale (8px grid, etc.)
4. Breakpoints - Mobile (320px-767px), Tablet (768px-1024px), Desktop (1025px+)
5. Components - Buttons (states), form elements, navigation, cards, icons, images
6. Layout - Grid system, container widths, section spacing, header/footer structure

For Each Page:
- Extract semantic HTML5 structure
- Generate clean, accessible CSS with custom properties
- Identify reusable components
- Note animations/transitions
- Export all images and assets

Output Format:
- Clean HTML5 semantic markup (no inline styles)
- Modern CSS with BEM or similar naming
- Commented code indicating sections
- Separate files for each page
- Assets organized in folders (images, icons, fonts)

WordPress Specific:
- Mark dynamic areas (post titles, content, featured images)
- Identify navigation areas and widget/sidebar locations
- Mark areas for WordPress loops
- Form fields compatible with Contact Form 7 or WPForms
```

### AI Instructions - Step by Step Process

Use "docs/AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md" as base reference.

#### 1. Verify Figma MCP is Ready
- Confirm MCP was checked in "Before You Start" section
- If user said "no" earlier, remind them to configure it first
- If user confirmed "yes", proceed with extraction

#### 2. Extract Markup from Figma
- Read `figmaPages[]` from `current-task.json`
- Get site name from task (slugified title)
- Create directory: `dev/html/[site-name]/` (this folder is in .gitignore)
- For each page in `task.figmaPages[]`:
  - Use `page.url` for Figma MCP extraction
  - Send the consolidated prompt above to Figma MCP
  - Get design context and code
  - Save to `dev/html/[site-name]/[page-name].html` and `[page-name].css`
- Use hamburger menu on mobile - be sure that navigation suits well, you must use hamburger menu as soon as navigation out of 1 line.
- Images should change size proportionally when resize

**Important:** HTML files are NOT committed to git - they're in .gitignore

#### 3. Download and Organize Assets
- Parse ALL asset URLs from Figma MCP response
- Download to organized folders: `images/`, `icons/`, `logos/`
- Verify each download (file size > 0)
- Update HTML with local paths

#### 4. Analyze Structure According to Task
- Compare extracted pages with `task.siteStructure.pages[]`
- Verify all pages from task are present in Figma
- Check page names match between Figma and task definition

**Show Analysis:**
```
📊 Markup Extraction Analysis:

✅ Extracted Pages ([count]):
- Homepage (Figma: "Homepage" → html: front-page.html)
- [List each page with mapping]

⚠️ Potential Issues:
- [List any mismatches or missing pages]

📁 Markup saved to: dev/html/[site-name]/
Note: This directory is in .gitignore and not committed to git
```

#### 5. Propose Validation
Ask user to review extracted markup:
```
🔍 Markup Validation Required:

I've extracted the markup from Figma. Please review:

Location: dev/html/[site-name]/
Files: [list HTML files created]

Note: These files are not tracked by git (.gitignore)

Options:
1. Looks good - proceed to next step
2. Need adjustments - let me know what to change
3. I'll review manually and get back to you

What would you like to do?
```

#### 6. Work with User on Adjustments
If user requests changes, ask specific questions:
- Which page needs adjustment?
- What specifically needs to change?
- Should I re-extract from Figma or modify existing markup?

#### 7. Update Task Status
- After user approves markup
- Change status in `current-task.json` to: `"Markup done"`

### Technical Implementation Requirements

#### 1. Separate Files and Structure
- Generate separate HTML and CSS files
- Use max-width for each block/section
- Strictly use provided Figma design

#### 2. Design Specifications
- **Pixel-perfect implementation**
- Use ALL icons and images from Figma MCP
- Do NOT invent anything not in the design

#### 3. Interaction and Visual Effects
- Include interactivity for buttons
- Add shadows and hover/click reactions
- Follow best practices for UI interactions

#### 4. Technical Details
- Generate semantic HTML with proper structure
- Create CSS with precise max-width for each section
- Include all visual elements:
  * Typography (fonts, sizes, colors, weights)
  * Colors and backgrounds
  * Spacing and layout (flexbox/grid)
  * Button styles and states
  * Images/media with proper src attributes
  * Icons (as SVG or icon classes)

#### 5. File Structure
- HTML file: `dev/html/[site-name]/[page-name].html`
- CSS file: `dev/html/[site-name]/[page-name].css`
- Assets: `dev/html/[site-name]/assets/[images|icons|logos]/`

### Organize Extracted Files

Create this structure:

```
dev/html/[site-name]/
├── [page-name].html
├── [page-name].css
├── ...
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    ├── icons/
    └── logos/
```

Optional - Create design system documentation file if needed:

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#......",
    "secondary": "#......"
  },
  "typography": {
    "fontFamilies": {
      "primary": "...",
      "headings": "..."
    },
    "fontSizes": {
      "h1": "...",
      "body": "..."
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "scale": [0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64],
    "containerMaxWidth": "1200px"
  },
  "breakpoints": {
    "mobile": "767px",
    "tablet": "1024px",
    "desktop": "1025px"
  }
}
```

### Questions to Ask User

**Before Extraction:**
- "Is Figma MCP authenticated and working? Can you access the Figma file?"
- "Should I extract all pages at once or one at a time?"
- "What's your preferred CSS methodology (BEM, utility-first, modules)?"

**During Extraction:**
- "I found [X] pages in Figma but task defines [Y] pages. Should I extract all?"
- "This component appears multiple times. Should I extract it as reusable?"
- "There are [X] font families. Do you have licenses/access to them?"

**After Extraction:**
- "The markup is ready. Would you like me to create a preview?"
- "Do you want me to optimize images before conversion?"
- "Are there any pages that need adjustments?"

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Figma MCP authentication fails | Guide user through re-authentication, check API token |
| Missing images in extraction | Re-export specific images, check export settings |
| Colors don't match exactly | Verify color profile (RGB vs HEX), check opacity/transparency |
| Fonts are different from Figma | Check font availability, provide web font alternatives |
| Layout breaks at breakpoints | Review Figma frames, add missing media queries |

### CSS Design Tokens Example

Generate CSS custom properties file when needed:

```css
/* variables.css - Generated from Figma Design System */

:root {
  /* Colors - Primary Palette */
  --color-primary: #......;
  --color-primary-dark: #......;
  --color-primary-light: #......;
  
  /* Colors - Secondary */
  --color-secondary: #......;
  
  /* Colors - Neutral */
  --color-background: #......;
  --color-text: #......;
  --color-border: #......;
  
  /* Typography */
  --font-primary: 'Font Name', sans-serif;
  --font-headings: 'Heading Font', serif;
  
  /* Font Sizes */
  --font-size-h1: 3rem;
  --font-size-h2: 2.5rem;
  --font-size-h3: 2rem;
  --font-size-body: 1rem;
  
  /* Spacing Scale */
  --space-xs: 0.25rem;
  --space-sm: 0.5rem;
  --space-md: 1rem;
  --space-lg: 1.5rem;
  --space-xl: 2rem;
  --space-2xl: 3rem;
  
  /* Breakpoints (for JS) */
  --breakpoint-mobile: 767px;
  --breakpoint-tablet: 1024px;
  --breakpoint-desktop: 1025px;
  
  /* Layout */
  --container-max-width: 1200px;
  --grid-gap: 1.5rem;
}
```

### Success Criteria

Before proceeding to Step 6, verify:

- [ ] All pages from `task.figmaPages[]` are extracted
- [ ] HTML is semantic and accessible
- [ ] CSS is organized and follows a consistent methodology
- [ ] All images/assets are downloaded and referenced correctly
- [ ] Design system tokens are documented (if applicable)

### Reference Documents
- Task Figma data: `current-task.json` → `figmaPages[]` (use `url` field for each page)
- Base AI instructions: `docs/AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

---

**Remember:** This markup will be the foundation for WordPress templates. Ensure it's clean, semantic, and well-organized before proceeding to Step 6.


REFACTOR
**Images:**

```php
// Organize images by type:
dev/html/[themeName]/assets/images/logo.* 
  → theme/assets/images/logo.*

dev/html/[themeName]/assets/images/icons/ 
  → theme/assets/images/icons/

dev/html/[themeName]/assets/images/[page]/ 
  → theme/assets/images/pages/[page]/

// Content images (uploaded via WordPress):
// Move to /uploads/ directory or note for user to upload
```


### Step 2: Extract Assets from HTML

```bash
# Find all asset references in HTML
grep -r "localhost:3845/assets" dev/html/[title]/ | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{40\}\.[a-z]*' | sort -u > asset-list.txt

# This creates list like:
# d915c1354e6f7b603747f520a7e54c82310305bc.svg
# 139d5e67c9bdb89e6a051b5dd6bc9023c2308045.svg
# etc.
```

### Step 3: Download Assets from Figma MCP Server

**If MCP Server is Still Running:**

```bash
# Download each asset
while read hash; do
  curl "http://localhost:3845/assets/$hash" -o "temp-assets/$hash"
done < asset-list.txt
```

**If MCP Server is Not Running:**

Ask user to:
1. Restart Figma MCP server
2. Re-export assets from Figma
3. Or provide alternative source for assets
